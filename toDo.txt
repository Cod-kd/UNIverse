JavaScript file:
    (DONE)  -Format + Optimize
    (DONE)  -Add comments
    (DONE)  -Separate code into more functions (optional)
    (DONE)  -Make the code more readable
    (DONE)  -Create a button with a home icon => when pressed, the Registration + Login buttons will be rendered on the screen
    
    -Debugging:
    (DONE)    -add a variable named success (boolean)
    (DONE)    -if the registration is successful => display the successful animation (samples)
    (DONE)    -else => display the error animation (samples)
    (DONE)    -add form validation to all inputs
    (DONE)    -add an inputInfoDiv which displays informations about the current input (eg. max length, min length, needs to include this/that etc.)
    (DONE)    -add id to all inputs for further PHP actions
    -add drag&drop interactivity to the infoCards => user can have "fun" with the cards
    (DONE)    -if a condition isn't met => the condition should stay in place
    (DONE)    -if a condition is met => the condition should be removed with the disappear
    (DONE)    -if a previous condition was met before, but now it's not met => that specified condition should appear with the appear animation
    (DONE)    -add a fetch method with the createProfile.php, assign the correct animations
    -split the main javascript file into small javascript files (separation like css)
    -upon registration completion, the user can save their 'UNIverse Card' (an imagine which replicates a small login card with the user's data on it) =>
        users can login via their cards (upload their card image)
        (DONE) -Saving steps: 1. The user enters his/her data through the registration.
        (DONE)        2. The registration was complete => a button appears saying "Get my UNIverse Card" + the card appears with the user's informations + informations are saved to database
        (DONE)        3. Upon "Get card" button press => user's "UNIverse Card" will be saved on the user's device, simultaneously the card is hashed to HEX value and saved into
                    the user's record
    -add a customized 'symbol' to every card so other user's can't replicate each others' cards
        -Login steps via UNIverse Card:
            1. The user uploads his/her saved UNIverse Card
            2. The email address is read from the card
            3. The program checks that the email is present in the database
            4. If present => the uploaded UNIverse Card is hashed to hex => if the uploaded image's hex is similar to the user's image hex in the database => Successful login
            5. If the email is present + user uploaded wrong image => Unsuccessful login
            6. If the email isnt present => user isn't registrated
            7. If an email isn't present on the card => wrong card
CSS:
    (CAN'T FINISH DUE TO BUG)   -change the radio button's "circle"'s center so the black circle inside is centered horizontally + vertically
    (DONE)    -add floating effect to the infoCards => replicates that they can be dragged
    -make the page responsive (bootstrap?)

PHP:
    (DONE)    -create createProfile.php for testing the connection with javascript fetch
    -add the javascript registration informations to the database upon fetching

Quick fixes:
    (DONE)    -backBtn isnt working while UNIcard is present
    (DONE)    -when backBtn is pressed on the last page of registration => UNIcard instantly appears (animation is missing)
    (DONE)    -nothing happens when the user clicks registerBtn
