JavaScript file:
    (DONE)  -Format + Optimize

    (DONE)    -check on the hasDrawn variable inside setupSignature function (necessary?)
    (DONE)    -modify the existing functions and remove their unnecessary parameters
    (DONE)    -change the console.errors into a better feature
    (DONE)    -make the code smaller, especially the fetches and functions that use the same logic (check for existing email/username function)
    
    -Debugging:
    (DONE)    -add a variable named success (boolean)
    (DONE)    -if the registration is successful => display the successful animation (samples)
    (DONE)    -else => display the error animation (samples)
    (DONE)    -add form validation to all inputs
    (DONE)    -add an inputInfoDiv which displays informations about the current input (eg. max length, min length, needs to include this/that etc.)
    (DONE)    -add id to all inputs for further PHP actions
    (DISMISSED)    -add drag&drop interactivity to the infoCards => user can have "fun" with the cards
    (DONE)    -if a condition isn't met => the condition should stay in place
    (DONE)    -if a condition is met => the condition should be removed with the disappear
    (DONE)    -if a previous condition was met before, but now it's not met => that specified condition should appear with the appear animation
    (DONE)    -add a fetch method with the createProfile.php, assign the correct animations
    -split the main javascript file into small javascript files (separation like css)
    (DONE)    -upon registration completion, the user can save their 'UNIverse Card' (an imagine which replicates a small login card with the user's data on it) => users can login via their cards (upload their card image)
        (DONE)-Saving steps: 1. The user enters his/her data through the registration.
        (DONE)        2. The registration was complete => a button appears saying "Get my UNIverse Card" + the card appears with the user's informations + informations are saved to database
        (DONE)        3. Upon "Get card" button press => user's "UNIverse Card" will be saved on the user's device, simultaneously the card is hashed to HEX value and saved into the user's record
    (DONE)    -add a customized 'symbol' to every card so other user's can't replicate each others' cards (pin code, QR code, custom image)
        -Login steps via UNIverse Card:
            1. The user uploads his/her saved UNIverse Card
            2. The email address is read from the card
            3. The program checks that the email is present in the database
            4. If present => the uploaded UNIverse Card is hashed to hex => if the uploaded image's hex is similar to the user's image hex in the database => Successful login
            5. If the email is present + user uploaded wrong image => Unsuccessful login
            6. If the email isnt present => user isn't registrated
            7. If an email isn't present on the card => wrong card
    (DONE)    -change the inputDetails div's width and position at the passwordInput part
    (DISMISSED)    -add the loading animation while communicating with the server
    (DONE)    -add the cursor loading effect while fetching the createProfile.php
    (DONE)    -fix the signature part of the registration => users shouldn't be able to click continueBtn if they havent drawn aynthing
    (EXTRA)    -add new feature => every continueBtn should be disabled by default => if the current's input's validation is correct => enable, at signature and UNIcard, only enable if signature was drawn / unicard was saved
    (DONE)    -when the user uploads their UNIcard and clicks login button => Screen should go blank / loading animation should be displayed
    (DONE)    -correct UNIcard => call the correct animation function with the text "Successful login!"
    (DONE)    -incorrect UNIcard => Response should be shown => "Wrong unicard"
    (DONE)    --> after showing response, wait 3 seconds and navigate the user to the main page / back to UNIcard login
    (DONE)    -correct login with email + password => Successful login text + successful animation + 3 sec delay + redirection to main page
CSS:
    (CAN'T FINISH DUE TO BUG)   -change the radio button's "circle"'s center so the black circle inside is centered horizontally + vertically
    (DONE)    -add floating effect to the infoCards => replicates that they can be dragged
    -make the page responsive (bootstrap?)
    (DONE)    -check for unused css selectors and remove / change them
    (DONE)    -fix the backBtn's rotation to 180 degrees

PHP:
    (DONE)    -create createProfile.php for testing the connection with javascript fetch
    (DONE)    -add the javascript registration informations to the database upon fetching
        (DONE)    -the inputted email adress's value (is it already present in users table? => if yes => response to use another email)
        (DONE)    -the inputted username's value (only accept if it isnt present in the users table)
        (DONE)    -LOGIC: 1 php file named checkExistingUser => the email / username is sent via the fetch and an SQL query is ran to check the availability of the value:
        (DONE)    -return true if it isnt present in users table
        (DONE)    -else return false
        (DONE)    -if true was returned => user can click the continueBtn
    (DONE)    -merge the checkExistingUsername.php with the checkExistingEmail.php
    (DONE)    -store the password in a more secure way (hash) inside database
    (DONE)    -when a user is created => created_at column should have the NOW() value
    (DONE)    -when the checkExistence.php runs => it should only check the records where deleted_at is null
    (DONE)    -change the code to use DRY
    (DONE)    -add validation to every data which is inputted
    (DONE)    -add error catching to every possible reason
    (DONE)    -change the database credentials file (connection.php) to .env

    (DONE)    -nothing happens when the user clicks registerBtn
    (DONE)    -the imagePasswd isnt saved into the database
    (DONE)    -add the .button class to the reset signature button

    (DONE)    -continueBtn shouldn't be available until a signature was drawn on the signatureCanvas
    (DONE)    -console log the final formData's values upon registerBtn press + ?add missing formData attribute called "imgPass" => this stores the UNIcard's hashed hex code?
    (DONE)    -when the user hovers the continueBtn at the signature part of the registration => animation plays, but it shouldn't (continueBtn is only disabled when user clicks it)
    (DONE)    -remove the unnecessary "center-con" div (#continueBtn / #backBtn is enough, no extra div needed)
    (DONE)    -rename the css selectors in the #continueBtn + #backBtn
    (DONE)    -check on the validation functions

    (DONE)    -extra feature => users will save their UNIcard with this name syntax --> username-UNIcard.jpg
    -after pressing the button to get the UNIcard => registration comes in without proper fade in
    -add button which shows the entered password at the login part
    (DONE)    -when someone uploads their UNIcard at login and presses login button => screen should fade out and return the response:
    (DONE)    -if UNIcard is correct --> Successful login message + main page shown
    (DONE)    -if UNIcard is incorrect --> Displays the corresponding error with the createErrorWindow function + throws the user back to the login part
    (DONE)    -in general login: add home button (same as at registration)
    (DONE)    -change the createErrorWindow function's name to "createResponseWindow" --> can display future messages not only errors (eg.: )
    (DONE)    -change the fade in effect at the registration part => should be as fast as at login part
    (DONE)    -add typing effect to the h1
    -when a user presses enter while focused on an input, the createFormStep function should be called
